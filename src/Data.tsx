Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.",

CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser. ",

        details: "The term UI/UX stands for user interface/user experience design and refers to the practice of designing digital products with a user-first approach. In other words, the point of UI/UX design is to create a product that will be both visually appealing and highly pleasant to interact with. A common misconception is that UI and UX come down to the same thing and that they are just one discipline, but that is not entirely true. They are separate disciplines that focus on different aspects of the user's journey with a digital product. However, they overlap in many ways and are so closely connected that they've largely merged into one profession. Let's take a look at the main differences between UX and UI before moving on to discuss what the UI/UX design process involves and why it matters to you. ",
